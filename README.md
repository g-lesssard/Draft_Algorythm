# Draft_Algorythm

Simple algorythm to generate CSV files to be read from Draft.xlsx for the annual Sharpool Draft

# Requirements
The project can currently only be used with python, but in the future a Rust project will be bundled in the repo.

## Python
You will need an internet connection as well as a python interpreter with the packages found in the requirements.txt file. 
Then, you can run the Database script to generate the CSVs needed by the xlsx file.
Enjoy.


## Rust

Currently not supported.
